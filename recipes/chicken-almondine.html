    <p>Chicken almondine is nothing more than dressed up simple chicken tenderloins with a buttery almond sauce. Just a few pantry items will turn your chicken main dish into something special. There were two thumbs up from my guys, so I'm a happy cook!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon herbes de provence</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>8 chicken tenderloins</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raw almonds</li>
        <li>3 green onions sliced, white and green parts separated</li>
        <li>2 gloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add flour, Herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper to a large resealable plastic bag. Mix and toss gently in the bag to evenly distribute. Add chicken tenderloins, close the bag, and toss until coated with flour mixture. </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When butter sizzles, add almonds and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes, being careful not to burn. </li>
        <li>Pour skillet contents through a wire mesh sieve, trapping the almonds in the sieve and collecting the butter in a heat-proof bowl. Wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel, and return the butter to the skillet, reserving the almonds for later.</li>
        <li>When the butter is hot again, add floured and seasoned tenderloins. Cook until each side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. </li>
        <li>Add only white parts of onions and minced garlic to the skillet around tenderloins; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Pour white wine and chicken broth around tenderloins, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 5 to 8 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet to a serving plate and keep warm. </li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium. When liquid bubbles, return almonds to the skillet. Adjust seasoning, if necessary, and cook until sauce thickens slightly,  2 to 3 minutes (See Cook's Note.) </li>
        <li>Pour almonds and sauce over chicken tenderloins. Garnish with reserved sliced green onion tops. </li>
    </ol>
